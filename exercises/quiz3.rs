// quiz3.rs

// This quiz tests:
// - Generics
// - Traits
//
// An imaginary magical school has a new report card generation system written
// in Rust! Currently the system only supports creating report cards where the
// student's grade is represented numerically (e.g. 1.0 -> 5.5). However, the
// school also issues alphabetical grades (A+ -> F-) and needs to be able to
// print both types of report card!
//
// Make the necessary code changes in the struct ReportCard and the impl block
// to support alphabetical report cards. Change the Grade in the second test to
// "A+" to show that your changes allow alphabetical grades.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint quiz3` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.

///as seen in hint we will use Display, a trait that is used to format the output of a type, as we did not know if it will be string or number 
use std::fmt::Display;
///we will use a generic type T that will implement Display trait
pub struct ReportCard <T: Display>{
    pub grade: T,
    pub student_name: String,
    pub student_age: u8,
}
///explain why first T:Display and for reportcard oly T
/// we use T:Display in the struct definition to specify that the grade field will be of a type that implements the Display trait. This is necessary because we want to be able to print the grade in the print method. We use T in the struct definition to specify that the ReportCard struct will be generic over a type T (no need to repeat the Display trait bound here, as it is already specified in the struct definition).
